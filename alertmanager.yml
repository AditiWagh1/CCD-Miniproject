global:
  # Optional: Define global email settings here if you wanted email alerts later

# The main routing tree for alerts
route:
  # The initial recipient for all alerts that don't match specific criteria
  receiver: 'null-receiver'

# Definition of the receivers (notification endpoints)
receivers:
  - name: 'null-receiver'
    # Since this is a minimal setup, we define the receiver but don't configure 
    # an actual webhook (like email or Slack). The alert will be processed and visible 
    # in the Alertmanager UI, proving the routing works.
